# Metehan-Altuntekin - Portfolio V1
My first portfolio page that is also the first website design I ever made. Nowadays I don't feel like it represents me well enough so I stopped using it.

## Tools
  There isn't much tools used, not even a framework is used. Even SCSS files are compiled with an extension on VS Code.
  
  - Figma
  - SASS
  - Vanilla JS
